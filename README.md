## What is continuous integration?
Continuous integration (CI) is a widespread software development practice that involves frequently committing code to a central repository.
Often refers to the build or integration stage of the software release process.
A major component of continuous integration is the use of automated test suites that are run to verify the integrity of the code being committed.
Many large-scale projects and organizations use continuous integration, including:
- NASAâ€™s mission control framework
- React.js
- Vim
- MongoDB
- League of Legends

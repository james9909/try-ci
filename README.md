You should try using continuous integration because...

## What is continuous integration?
Continuous integration (CI) is a widespread software development practice that involves frequently committing code to a central repository.
Often refers to the build or integration stage of the software release process.
A major component of continuous integration is the use of automated test suites that are run to verify the integrity of the code being committed.
Many large-scale projects and organizations use continuous integration, including:
- NASAâ€™s mission control framework
- React.js
- Vim
- MongoDB
- League of Legends

## Why use continuous integration?
- It allows developers to detect and locate the source of errors quickly
- Promotes collaboration between team members so recent code is always shared
- Reduces time and effort spent on integrating changes to the main code base
- Reduces overhead between the development and deployment processes
- Analyses and metrics generated from automated tests (including code coverage, code complexity, and linting) help keep a healthy codebase
- Code with confidence knowing that project standards are being adhered to and that the product is functioning

## How does it work?
1.  A developer commits changes to a central repository
2. The CI server monitoring the repository notices a new commit, checks out the code, and executes a master build script
3.  The CI server labels the build as passing or failing and notifies the team
4. If the build fails, the developer knows to take immediate action.  Once they have corrected the problem, the cycle repeats.
5. If the build passes, celebrate!

## Tools for CI
Popular CI servers:
- Travis, Jenkins, Gitlab

### Automated test tools:
- pytest,  nose (Python)
- mocha (node.js)
- JUnit, Cactus (Java)

### Automated build tools:
- Maven, ant, make, rake, gulp, grunt

## Best practices
- Use a version control system
- Use a standardized build script/tool that can be called from the command line
- Commit frequently
- Keep the builds relatively short (< 1 hour) and use parallel builds
- Test using a replica of the production environment
- Make it easy to view the results of a build
